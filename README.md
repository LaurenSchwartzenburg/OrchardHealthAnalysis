# Orchard Health Analysis Dashboards

These are ag-tech dashboards built using a combination of field data and visual assessments from multiple sources. It highlights changes in tree health over two consecutive seasons following a severe drought, focusing on a newly established fruit and tree nut orchard. Irrigation improvements helped increase health substantially.

Healthy: Trees with no health issues, showing strong leaf and trunk quality
Treat: Trees needing immediate care due to health decline, pests, or damage
Vacant: Trees that did not survive into the following season

This project demonstrates how small to medium agricultural operations can use digital tools and visual tracking to monitor crop health and plan interventions effectively. It lays the groundwork for more robust data collection. 

This is a growing collection of interactive dashboards exploring Ag Tech and Orchard Health Analysis and will include data visualizations built using multiple tools such as Tableau, Plotly, and Streamlit. 

## Tools Used
- Tableau Public (for geospatial and comparative dashboards)
- Plotly (upcoming interactive visualizations)
- Streamlit (planned web apps and data exploration tools)
